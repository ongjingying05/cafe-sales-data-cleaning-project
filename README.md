# cafe-sales-data-cleaning-project
In this data cleaning case study project, I will be practicing data cleaning with SQL on a cafe sales dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains 10,000 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions in a cafe. It is intentionally "dirty," with missing values, inconsistent data, and errors introduced to provide a realistic scenario for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. I will also be performing basic data exploration using the cleaned dataset by answering some simple made up business questions.

Queries used:  
⦁	CAST  
⦁	CASE WHEN  
⦁	GROUP BY  
⦁	UNION ALL  
⦁	Arithmetic and logical operators  
⦁	Aggregate functions  
⦁	Temporary tables  

BigQuery is used for this project. Data obtained from Kaggle: [Cafe Sales - Dirty Data for Cleaning Training](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training)
